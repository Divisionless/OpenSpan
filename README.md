# OpenSpan

**Drive your iPad from your PC — keyboard, mouse, audio, and clipboard — over Bluetooth. Free, local, no cloud, no account.**

OpenSpan turns a Windows PC into a Bluetooth peripheral for a nearby iPad.
Shove your mouse off a screen edge (Universal Control / Input Director style)
and your keyboard and mouse drive iPadOS directly — type in Messages, scroll
Safari, switch apps. Cross back and you're on the PC again. On the same
Bluetooth radio it also routes your PC audio to Bluetooth earbuds and keeps a
two-way clipboard in sync between the two devices.

No paid software, no account, no telemetry. A small Windows app plus a headless
Linux VM doing the one thing Windows won't: pretending to be a Bluetooth
keyboard.

---

## Why a VM?

Windows deliberately blocks applications from publishing the Bluetooth HID
(keyboard/mouse) service — the OS reserves it. Linux's BlueZ does not. So
OpenSpan runs a headless Debian 12 VM that owns the PC's Bluetooth radio (via
USB passthrough) and advertises as a BLE HID keyboard; a Windows app captures
your real input and streams it in.

```

                                                    ▼
                                                  iPad  (bonded BLE keyboard)

PC audio ─▶ VB-Cable ─▶ WASAPI loopback ── UDP :4010 ──▶ VM: PipeWire ─▶ A2DP ─▶ earbuds
```

The single radio time-shares both jobs (BLE HID to the iPad, A2DP audio to the
earbuds). Keeping the BLE link's airtime modest is what lets the audio stay
clean — see `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md`.

## Features

- **Keyboard + mouse bridge** — cross a screen edge to control the iPad; a
  keymap remaps modifiers (Alt→Cmd, Ctrl+C→Cmd+C, …).
- **Bluetooth audio routing** — send Windows audio to BT earbuds through the
  same radio, with the normal Windows volume slider and an in-app L/R balance.
- **Two-way clipboard** — plain **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V** keep both machines in sync
  (via Apple Shortcuts + a tiny token-guarded LAN relay). See
  `CLIPBOARD_SETUP.md`.
- **Compact mode** — collapse to a small always-handy panel (status, volume,
  balance) or the system tray.
- **One-click connect + auto-reconnect** — the app retries a stubborn pairing
  and brings the earbuds back on its own after the bridge boots.
- **Single-file build** — packages to one `OpenSpan.exe` (see `BUILD.md`).

## Hard-won facts (read before you "fix" something)

These cost real debugging; they are the difference between working and not:

1. **BLE, not Classic.** Classic (BR/EDR) HID emulation *pairs* with an iPad
   but the iPad never accepts the keystrokes. Apple only cooperates over **BLE
   HID (HID-over-GATT / HOGP)**. OpenSpan is BLE.
2. **xHCI (USB 3.0) passthrough, not EHCI/OHCI.** The USB 1.1/2.0 controllers
   dropped the Intel radio under streaming load; xHCI enumerates it in ~8 s and
   holds. `VBoxManage modifyvm OpenSpan --usbxhci on` (needs the Extension
   Pack), plus `usbcore.autosuspend=-1` and `options btusb enable_autosuspend=0`
   so the radio never idle-suspends.
3. **`encrypt-read` forces the bond.** iOS will connect to a BLE keyboard and
   even subscribe *without bonding*, then silently ignore every keystroke.
   Marking the HID report characteristics `encrypt-read` forces iOS to bond,
   which activates the keyboard.
4. **Dual mode + not discoverable.** The adapter runs `ControllerMode = dual`
   (BR/EDR stays enabled — the audio needs it) with `Discoverable = false`, so
   the iPad sees one clean LE keyboard entry instead of a second, un-pairable
   Classic decoy. The LE connection interval is pinned to 15–30 ms
   (`MinConnectionInterval = 12` / `MaxConnectionInterval = 24`): tighter
   starves the audio, looser makes the mouse laggy.

## Running it (Windows side)

Launch `OpenSpan.exe` (build it with `python build_exe.py`) or `OpenSpan.bat`.
From plain source: `python win/openspan.py` — note Windows' unsigned-app
reputation gate may block a raw `pythonw.exe`; `BUILD.md` explains the packaged
exe and the interpreter workaround. The control app starts/stops the bridge VM
and the input portal, arranges the iPad among your monitors, and edits the
keymap. In the portal, cross the arranged edge to control the iPad;
**Ctrl+Alt+Q** bails out, **Ctrl+Alt+I** toggles manually.

## Setup — honest status

The **Windows side is turnkey** (pure standard-library Python; `pycaw` is an
optional extra for the volume slider). The **VM side currently requires manual
setup** and is the actively-worked rough edge (see *Roadmap*). Today it means:
create a Debian 12 VM named `OpenSpan` with xHCI USB passthrough for your
Bluetooth radio and NAT forwards (`2222→22`, `9955→9955`, and UDP `4010→4010`
for audio), then install the `guest/` scripts + systemd units under
`/opt/openspan`. For SSH access, the app **generates its key (`id_openspan`)
automatically on first launch**; install its public half in the VM with
`guest/install-authorized-key.sh` (pass `id_openspan.pub`), which the guided
provisioner will run for you. `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` documents
every piece; a guided provisioner that does this end-to-end is the next
milestone, so a clone is **not yet a one-command install**.

**iPad pairing:** Bluetooth ▸ tap **OpenSpan Keyboard** ▸ accept the prompt.
It auto-reconnects after that. (`Settings ▸ General ▸ Keyboard ▸ Hardware
Keyboard` appears once bonded — a handy check.)

## Roadmap

- **Working & tested:** BLE keyboard + mouse, edge crossing, keymap remaps,
  Bluetooth audio routing (volume + balance), two-way clipboard, compact mode,
  auto-reconnect, single-file exe.
- **In progress:** a reproducible VM — first-run SSH-key provisioning, a
  create-VM script, and a full guest provisioner — so setup becomes turnkey.
- **Known limits:** BLE sends *relative* mouse motion, so the pointer can drift
  (a corner-park re-sync is planned); touch-made copies on the iPad don't
  auto-sync to the clipboard (use Ctrl+C).
